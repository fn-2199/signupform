Project: Sign-Up Form from TheOdinProject

This is the fifth project assigned by The Odin Project. We are to create a sign-up page styled in any way we want, as long we had the required form controls. Some new skills I utilized were emmet shortcuts that made writing html more efficient and css units that are better suited and responsive for accessiblity. I also coded my own face font, stylized the form controls, used the opacity property and the power of positioning, applied advanced selectors, defined custom css variables, refactored my code to accomodate smaller screens, and used regex pattern for validation.

My favorite feature would have to be the animation I applied to a text to imitate a neon sign. For larger screen sizes such as a desktop computer, the neon sign would be out of the webpage flow and positioned relative to the main container. For smaller screens like mobile phones, I sticked it back above the main title. One useful thing I learned during this project was setting an element's height to auto. I came to find that this allows the element to automatically adjust its height to allow its content to be displayed correctly and in a more symmetrical way. 

Most of the form controls are set to required so in order to relay that message across users who rely on screen readers, I used the abbr element to contain the text "required." Moreover, I hid its visibility by setting its color to match the background color. This way it doesn't mess with the aesthetic of the web page and the text will still be read.
